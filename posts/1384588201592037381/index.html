<div>it's a win-win, honestly! members of the body, downtown business owners, have complained about poor parking enforcement for quite some time & the police department complains about being understaffed & too busy. https://t.co/Lv3MLxipYW</div>

<div>as the name states, they're purely an advisory body. but hopefully if they come to city council with a recommendation that parking enforcement be taken away from the police department & handled by unarmed civilian employees, that recommendation will be taken seriously.</div>

<div>again from that november meeting, this won't be a quick change - it has to go through an RFP process. but the sooner they get the idea in front of council, the sooner we can get started on the process. https://t.co/vi0KXK1LeD</div>

<div>ok, we have quorum. kirby hutto will remain a member of the panel but would like to step down as chair. he nominates joan fenton to replace him & she accepts. the motion carries & joan will chair the rest of the meeting. https://t.co/XAIWBH1dSQ</div>

<div>siebert says the goal of the parking enterprise fund was to create a self-sustaining revenue stream independent of the city's general fund to cover costs related to parking. its purpose in practice is honestly kind of murky to me. https://t.co/1T513YgGZP</div>

<div>"we actually had a loss this year," siebert says, of about $600,000. (it's no surprise that parking revenues were down during the pandemic - most downtown parking demand is driven by office workers, who worked from home in 2020.)</div>

<div>joan fenton says there was originally a plan to use parking enterprise fund money to "promote downtown businesses." she asks if that's still going to happen or if that money is "just going to sit in the bank." (joan is a downtown business owner)</div>

<div>"i hope that all possible uses are within our purview and not just some of them," says panel member jake mooney about the possibility of spending that parking enterprise money. (what if we used revenue from car parking to fund transportation alternatives?!)</div>

<div>as to parking enforcement, currently the cost of parking enforcement is part of the police dept budget but the REVENUE from parking tickets goes to the parking enterprise fund. if they switched to a private enforcement contract, the enterprise fund may have to pay for it.</div>

<div>siebert says he originally drafted an RFP for contracting out parking enforcement in may 2019 but the city manager at the time chose not to move forward with it. i don't think this ever came before council...??</div>

<div>michael rodi asks what bearing the police chief's stance on the issue has - is it possible for the city manager to move forward with the RFP without her blessing? siebert says the police chief reports to the city manager, but "in practical terms, i'm not really sure that's true."</div>

<div>kirby hutto says from a police officer's POV, they worry about contracting it out because what if someone getting a parking ticket "flies off the handle" and you "need your policing power" but how often is the driver even PRESENT when the parking ticket is being written?</div>

<div>the city manager we had in 2019 who rejected this RFP last time is no longer employed by the city & the political climate regarding policing has changed significantly in the last two years. hopefully the answer is yes this time.</div>

<div>it's hard to make 5 year plans without hard data. so much of the conversation about parking in this city is driven by how people FEEL and unsubstantiated, often second-hand or poorly remembered personal experiences about not being able to find a parking spot. we need data.</div>

<div>kirby hutto suggests having some way of measuring the success of things like the park & ride lot - all we have is anecdotal evidence that it's not well utilized. jake mooney adds that the best data we have on parking garage utilization is a data visualizer made by @whatthecarp.</div>

<div>@RoryStolzenberg has a public comment -- in 2024, the ground lease for the land under the market street garage resets to market rate. we're currently paying a greatly reduced amount. what is the outlook for longterm profitability of the parking enterprise fund given that info?</div>

<div>siebert says no one has made any projections related to that issue. he does not know any specifics about what will happen or what it will cost. this is going to be a significant change in operating costs and 2024 is not that far off.</div>
