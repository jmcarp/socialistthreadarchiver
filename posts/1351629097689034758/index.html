<div>chip says moving forward there needs to be an updated study on demand for parking - in the post-COVID world, demand for parking for office workers will likely be reduced (but i'm not sure how we study something as unpredictable as how people will behave when the plague passes?)</div>

<div>city parking director rick siebert says the entire parking industry is asking this question right now - no one really knows what demand will look like after COVID. "we're a little bit away from having real numbers to determine what our needs are gonna be," chip boyles says.</div>

<div>garland williams is optimistic about a project in its early stages to better coordinate service between CAT & UTS. he also asks for a copy of the 2015 parking study to get a better idea of where the pressure points are with parking & how transit can help alleviate them.</div>

<div>brennen duncan, the city's traffic engineer, says they should do a study of where city employees are parking & possibly implementing more permitted residential parking for the neighborhood streets that downtown employees park on to avoid paid/timed parking downtown.</div>

<div>joan fenton says she suspects much of the office space will end up converted to residential - is there enough parking for that? "when the rents decrease on the commercial, all of a sudden we have apartments," she says.</div>

<div>siebert expresses interest in getting local data on single occupancy vehicle use (we have national & regional data, but he's looking for specifically city-level data). duncan says he's not sure how we'd get that data (the regional data is from the census).</div>

<div>chip boyles says VDOT has a contract with a company called streetlight that buys & aggregates data from cell phones, allowing you to see granular information about how people move around. TJPD currently has free access to some of this data.</div>
