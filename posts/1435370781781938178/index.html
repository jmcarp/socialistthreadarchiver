<div>if i'm understanding this correctly, the new dispatch system sends the closest unit NO MATTER WHAT the unit's capabilities are or what the emergency requires, so ALS units get sent to BLS calls, taking them offline during actual ALS calls?</div>

<div>lisa robertson, the city attorney, says city council will be briefed by their own fire chief. she's being painfully careful with her words, probably because CARS has already sent their lawyer to talk to her about this.</div>

<div>kate fraleigh says council should act swiftly to adopt the ordinance & hearing procedures for the PCRB, which is nice i guess but i'm not sure the PCRB is worth anything at all if they can climb into bed with the police union. chip boyles says hansel aguilar starts on the 27th.</div>
