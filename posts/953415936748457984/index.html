          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/953448958864580608" target="_blank">many speakers take issue with wes bellamy’s proposed time change. meeting at 5:30 or 6 means many people won’t be able to get here. meeting start at 7 and go really late... but if we split comment to a different night or something, it’d be easy to meet 7-9 2x/week or so</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/953449368299991041" target="_blank">several speakers have also brought up that two years ago, council stopped letting people finish their sentence at the end of their time. they just speak over you, shout you down. it’s disrespectful. (signer &amp; galvin we’re elected two years ago... not a coincidence)</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/953455671768477697" target="_blank">a lot of talking about talking about deciding to talk about it later. this is meaningless.  problem: the meeting would be too long.  solution: SPLIT IT INTO TWO MEETINGS. THERE ARE MORE DAYS THAN MONDAYS Y’ALL</a>
