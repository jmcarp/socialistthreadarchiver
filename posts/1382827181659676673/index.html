<div>commissioner wolfgang keppley points out that the ADA office is part of neighborhood development services, which is under the deputy city manager of operations, NOT the office of equity & inclusion - ADA issues are "people centered," they argue - not just issues of code.</div>

<div>"the state often lags behind progressive cities," says kathryn. by demonstrating that the program works & helps keep people in their homes, hopefully it will make it easier for the state to change the law & establish similar programs statewide.</div>

<div>"it doesn't feel good not to say anything about it," harris says, though no one is quite certain where it falls with in the city's human rights commission's purview. (policing IS a human rights problem!)</div>

<div>charlottesville city schools drew heavily from a model from toronto where the school hires more adult support staff to be in the school, but there are no police officers or security type personnel. cville schools are also hiring more social workers.</div>

<div>ernest chambers says the work of the BUCK squad is good but todd's suggestion that supporting their work as a way of addressing the issue of police violence isn't gonna cut it - those aren't the situations where cops are killing people.</div>

<div>kathryn laughon says there is work being done all over in odd little pockets that the HRC can endorse, for example: the parking advisory board has talked about removing parking enforcement from the police department's duties. why are armed cops writing parking tickets?</div>

<div>lyndele says to sue's argument that they'd have to issue too many statements that it's the right thing to do. "this work is important. it needs to be done." "i don't think we need to choose when to say it and when not to say it." "we need to say it all the time."</div>

<div>maybe if an official city commission issues a public statement condemning murder by police every time the police murder someone and that turns out to be a couple times a week people will realize what a horrific epidemic of state sanctioned murder we have.</div>

<div>on to public comment. don gathers says any time this issue comes up, "a statement needs to be made, i don't care how frequent that is, even if it's every day twice a day. any time this issue of racism & hatred rears its ugly head," people need to speak up.</div>

<div>i also made a rare public comment to thank lyndele for saying the human rights commission doesn't need permission to weigh in on police violence. cops killing people is the ultimate human rights violation - of course it's within their purview!</div>
