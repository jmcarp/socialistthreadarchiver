          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413265769119559681" target="_blank">board member james watson has called into the meeting, but indicated he is otherwise engaged and will not be able to participate. unclear to me if this sort of presence counts toward quorum. member deirdre gilmore is not present &amp; no one has been in contact with her.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413266558298869760" target="_blank">jeff fogel, a local civil rights attorney, has called in to public comment to detail some of his own experience with internal affairs. he assisted laquinn gilmore in his complaint against the police department after he was brutalized earlier this year.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413266750280450057" target="_blank">fogel says when gilmore was interviewed by IA, they were told the police would videotape the interview &amp; they would be provided with a copy of the tape - but they never got their copy. they were also denied the names of other officers who were present at the scene.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413266999585787905" target="_blank">gilmore's complaint was eventually determined by IA to be founded &amp; the officer was fired. gilmore has since filed a lawsuit   https://t.co/P8ZlwFSOxy</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413267294877364229" target="_blank">the general thrust of fogel's comment, though, was that even when the police internal investigation process WORKS, it's uncomfortable and difficult - maybe even impossible without an attorney. he hopes the PCRB can improve the whole process.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413269288283217922" target="_blank">fracher has been sitting in on the interviews. in the next round, two members of the board will sit in on the interviews. in the final round, the entire board will be allowed to give input to the city manager on their choice.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413271020631384070" target="_blank">bill mendez says the board should meet in closed session with their attorney to talk through their proposed hearing procedures "so we can speak freely." there is an exemption under the open meeting law for "legal advice," so i guess this is a choice they can make.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413271329537765376" target="_blank">specific legal questions for which they need specific, privileged legal counsel can absolutely take place in closed session! but this really feels like they're simply having the lawyer present to take advantage of the exemption.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413271581015556101" target="_blank">bill &amp; bellamy have both repeatedly expressed such hostility to the very idea of having to work in public. this is contrary to the spirit of public service and harmful to their mission of gaining public trust in the process, but i've said this before.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413272215768997891" target="_blank">board member nancy carpenter says she has no problem speaking in public and wants to know why the entire discussion has to take place in closed session, citing the fact that the previous board never went into closed session in crafting the original ordinance.</a>
        </div>
      
        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413272746482675714" target="_blank">bellamy brown says if they were to "open up to public view" their discussion, it could "open us up to liability." it's unclear what kind of legal liability there is to having a conversation about a proposed framework for a public body.</a>
        </div>
      
        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413273409853792261" target="_blank">their attorney, cynthia hudson, says the conversation itself doesn't need to take place in closed session, but it will likely cause board members to have questions that will necessitate her giving legal advice or opinion, which she says is typically privileged.</a>
        </div>
      
        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413273412475129857" target="_blank">hudson says waiving that right would mean those conversations and that advice "could later be used against you." it kind of feels like there may be some underlying assumption that someone will sue the PCRB? that would be truly explosive.</a>

        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413273411166539777" target="_blank">(she does point out that as the clients, they can absolutely choose to waive that and have that conversation in a public meeting)</a>

        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413273607992713222" target="_blank">the more they try to explain why they need absolute secrecy to discuss the framework of how the public body will function, the worse it feels!</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413274035472015361" target="_blank">"there could be a suit later on by a police, civilian, or sworn employee who has been adversely affected by some action of the board," hudson says.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413274257396838401" target="_blank">if the reason for that adverse effect stems from the construction of the ordinance, she says this "legal conversation around those choices" would be admissible into evidence.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413274258629873664" target="_blank">nancy carpenter says she got into this public service work to serve the public, in public. she wants a concrete reason for why the public's work should be done behind closed doors.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413274665594855428" target="_blank">bill mendez says when the old board was meeting, "the most expensive lawyer in charlottesville" started showing up at all their meetings. (he's referring to denise lunsford, who serves as counsel for the police union)</a>

        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413274914384134147" target="_blank">(from personal experience, i can say she isn't a particularly confident civil litigator - when she tried to sue me for hurting a cop's feelings, she backed down immediately when i got a fancy new york lawyer - bill should worry less)</a>
        </div>
      
        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413275889379549187" target="_blank">nancy again affirms her unwillingness to do the public's business in closed session - saying they're too worried about a possible outcome that may come to pass. bill again calls denise (not by name) "influential" by her mere presence at meetings.</a>
        </div>
      
        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413276046410100737" target="_blank">sorry, but if bill mendez is so intimidated by the idea of the police union attorney LOOKING AT HIM while he conducts public business, i don't think he has the stomach for police oversight. toughen up.</a>

        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413276908725456903" target="_blank">the board has voted to hold a special meeting on july 14 to review the ordinance draft &amp; proposed hearing procedures. it sounds like they will vote at the top of that meeting whether to enter closed session for the discussion.</a>
        </div>
      
        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413278072321847302" target="_blank">i would love a police oversight body that isn't so ready to admit they're scared of making the police unhappy. they're not gonna fight for us. they'll fold like a cheap umbrella at the first sign of pushback. hell, they're already folding and there's been none yet!</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413278886167781381" target="_blank">back to public comment. harold folley says ultimately it's about accountability for everyone - police break rules like anybody else &amp; should be held accountable, too. he refers to the case last year where a cop was cleared by IA but later convicted of assault.</a>

        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1413279387273908229" target="_blank">well, with no actual business being addressed aside from the unresolved issue of whether they'll have their actual conversation about this work in closed session next week, they've adjourned the meeting.</a>
