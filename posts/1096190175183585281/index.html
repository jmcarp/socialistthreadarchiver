<div>ok. after sitting quietly in my car for a few minutes i feel like i can drive home. i cannot properly express how ugly this has been. white supremacy is so deeply engrained in every aspect of our existence.</div>

<div>even as a white person with no children, no real stake in these school policies, i feel traumatized by this. i cannot imagine the toll this is taking on students of color and their families. this community has fought so hard. and we will continue to fight.</div>

<div>being in constant fear that speaking will result in criminal charges or even physical harm, even as they use bad faith free speech arguments to perpetuate harm against children... it‚Äôs violence. these meetings are violence.</div>

<div>seeing my friends brutalized by police at a school board meeting a few months ago, hearing bored politicians blithely erase the very real harm their policies do to living breathing people, hearing survivors of white supremacist violence ignored when they bravely speak out,</div>

<div>folks outside the cville/albemarle area must be reading this and thinking we‚Äôre some backwards fucked up exception. i wish we were. go to your own school board meetings. peel back the thin veneer of civility. you can paint over mold, but they‚Äôre all rotten at the core.</div>
