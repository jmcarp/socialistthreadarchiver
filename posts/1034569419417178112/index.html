<div>john blair: “the best step right now would be to try to draft those bylaws” the subtext here seems to be that council doesn’t want the CRB to DO anything this year. just write bylaws. they’re kicking the can on police accountability.</div>

<div>mayor walker says, in a vague and roundabout way, that they didn’t envision the work of the board beginning until year two. sarah burke pushes back - they need to collect information about things like data privacy in order to write the bylaws. https://t.co/LgdGvAfFcr</div>

<div>heather hill tells the board “you should be able to access” the current system that collects complaints about police. john blair seems less reassuring - he asks if they are looking for aggregate data (# and type of complaints) or specific information about individual complaints?</div>

<div>john blair says the CRBs in fairfax & virginia beach are “another layer in the internal affairs process,” which allows them to keep information about people filing complaints from being FOIA’ed - they’re technically part of personnel records, which are exempt.</div>

<div>mayor walker says of the CRB being in “activity mode” - “you’re not supposed to be there” until after the final. tales have been written & accepted by council and that council would have to vote on whether they can collect information before that is done.</div>

<div>ms katrina says the police chief told her she “doesn’t know if she’s allowed” to provide police department policies to her. sarah burke says she’s FOIA’ed a lot of this information already and will provide what she has.</div>

<div>the board’s current budget is $2500. this obviously won’t cover outside counsel, travel to other cities’ board meetings, and full dinner provided to all board members at every meeting (an issue don has raised at every meeting so far)</div>

<div>the next meeting will be on september 11. the website shows it’ll be in this same basement conference room, but the board agrees this is insufficient. they’re discussing alternatives, including council chambers & cityspace. the library is a tough sell due to a 9pm closing time.</div>

<div>the board has not elected any officers and is instead using a system of rotating chairs and notetakers. josh bowers will chair september meetings with notes taken by sarah burke. meeting adjourned. location of the 9/11 meeting is still TBD.</div>
