          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425957591541288962" target="_blank">they're talking about this draft like it's actually 100% better and we're all just wrong because we were looking at the wrong draft... but i'm looking at the right document now and it really isn't fully reflective of a board that heard &amp; incorporated the community's concerns.</a>
        </div>
      
        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425957915165351942" target="_blank">and as of a moment ago, it's no longer a draft. the PCRB has adopted the hearing ordinance, the july draft from their website, with one minor change (this section was amended to say ten business days)  https://t.co/0NuyVemcsr</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425958911459397632" target="_blank">so now the board is discussing the ordinance. bill mendez tells the rest of the board that the most recent draft was emailed to them an hour ago... so i guess we are once again listening to them talk about a document we cannot see.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425960205091844099" target="_blank">teresa hepler from LAJC says the provision in the ordinance that says the PCRB will investigate complaints it determines merit such an investigation leaves a lot of questions about what complaints will be investigated. the public deserves to know.</a>

        <div class="tweet">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425960628863315976" target="_blank">sarah burke says they should give the PCRB director &amp; staff authority to conduct investigations instead of always outsourcing it to third parties, which will result in prohibitive costs &amp; complaints going uninvestigated.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425960916164751363" target="_blank">burke also notes that the ordinance only permits the PCRB to make disciplinary RECOMMENDATIONS only in "serious" cases - they should be able to make recommendations regardless of the severity of the complaint.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425961054807412744" target="_blank">burke closes out her comments by suggesting that the most recent version of all the documents being discussed at a meeting should be included in the agenda packet so we're all looking at the same materials.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425961810130345987" target="_blank">bill mendez says allowing PCRB staff to investigate complaints could create a conflict, as a city employee evaluating police conduct is not "independent," and also having in house investigation as an option could prevent spending on outside investigation when needed</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425962489603399682" target="_blank">mendez also says sarah's suggestion to allow the PCRB to make recommendations in any case they see fit, not just "serious" ones deserves further discussion &amp; he's willing to delay a vote to make that change.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425963213259223044" target="_blank">the lawyer, cynthia hudson, says it might be more appropriate to vote on the doc the public has seen, rather than vote on a resolution no one has had a chance to see before. (this is in response to repeated complaints from the public about them doing what bill is trying to do)</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425963812847505410" target="_blank">i'm honestly not 100% sure if they voted on the ordinance as it appears online or the version bill sent the board an hour before the meeting, but at least it isn't the version he wrote 30 seconds ago? whichever it was, it passed.</a>

          <a href="https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1425965929406603270" target="_blank">i personally don't think it's appropriate for the police civilian review board to be hijacked as a vehicle for cops to have their workplace morale issues addressed! take it to the HR director  (this is a joke because i think the city still doesn't have one)</a>
