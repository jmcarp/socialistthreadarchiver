<div>heather hill says she does not agree, and that the fact that wells wanted brackney fired actually just made the decision more complicated for boyles because he wanted to fire her for unrelated reasons (this is an absolutely ridiculous contortion, she can't possibly believe this)</div>

<div>maybe one asshole detective from a neighboring county should not get to decide who our police chief is and we should get a city manager who knows that</div>

<div>the mayor says she knows the story will be spun that it was not appropriate for her to record boyles but i think she made the right choice there. maybe every word out of that man's mouth needs to be entered into the public record, since he won't even tell us who he meets with.</div>

<div>heather says there were other reasons the chief got fired and the decision was not influenced by mr wells at all... but can't really come up with any reason why she thinks we should believe she believes that.</div>
