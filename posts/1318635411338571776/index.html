<div>rick siebert, the city's parking director, asked brian wheeler at the top of the meeting if recording the meetings was an acceptable substitute for taking minutes. it isn't. minutes are legally required for public bodies, but as a staff advisory body they wouldn't have to, right?</div>

<div>people with monthly parking passes are being allowed to suspend their monthly garage pass during this time. (because of the wait list of over 100 people, simply terminating it would mean you can't get it back)</div>

<div>joan fenton says parking enforcement has been a problem (in that it isn't done at all) and when it is done, there have been issues with officers being rude. "this is something the police do not need to be doing."</div>

<div>"i agree with rick - the police chief just didn't want to give up the responsibility," joan says. but the lack of enforcement is so consistent that people just assume they won't get tickets and violate parking rules.</div>

<div>as part of an agreement between the city & the county, the county will keep their courthouses in their current historic location in court square. in return, the city has to provide 90 dedicated downtown parking spaces. so... we're gonna build a whole parking garage.</div>

<div>siebert says the final garage will have 10,000ft of street front retail and 250+ parking spots. the project has to be by-right - there is concern that any need for variances to be granted will slow it down & we won't meet our obligation to the county.</div>

<div>if the city fails to deliver, they have to give the county back the half of the surface lot they bought from the county & the county gets to use the entire ground floor of an existing garage (missed whether he said market or water, but water would be a lot more spots)</div>

<div>oh it's like the wild west out here, rory is back on! he says there's no harm just giving restaurants the ability to have the parklets, rather than charging them by the day. it's not a lot of $ to the city, but restaurants may be unwilling to take any risk right now.</div>
