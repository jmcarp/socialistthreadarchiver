<div>there's no posted agenda for today's meeting, but wayne hayslett notes that the city website is currently advertising two open positions on the board. teresa says buzz, the current citizen rep for the board, doesn't plan to re-apply.</div>

<div>wayne says there isn't really much "immobilization" going on in charlottesville - no one is doing booting right now. (it was discussed several times in 2019, promoted by downtown business owners, but ultimately the idea was dropped) https://t.co/fyLK3HtUDh https://t.co/9Q6tW98N31</div>

<div>ultimately, i think the towing companies are opposed to allowing businesses to contract with companies like barnacle for immobilization because it takes the towing company out of the loop https://t.co/PXDJLzbZnT</div>

<div>the product being promoted by some downtown business is called THE BARNACLE & it is affixed to the car's windshield. hayslett, the towing company rep on the towing advisory board, says he can't even get an answer from his insurance company about its use https://t.co/SboEcG5OEk</div>

<div>wayne has obliquely referenced in almost every meeting SOME tow truck company operating in competition with his that is constantly violating various regulations & laws! bridgett just said she can't believe this unnamed company is even legally allowed to operate...</div>

<div>i would watch a reality tv show about the drama between charlottesville's tow truck companies. both towing industry reps on the board (bridgett hipes, small town towing & recovery) & wayne hayslett (FBR towing) keep referring to some DRAMA with another company...</div>

<div>it's been years since my car got towed, but i do recall a certain lot on high st that claimed at the time that they "can only take cash" and demanded a lot more cash than they are legally allowed to charge</div>

<div>the towing advisory board is in agreement that the ordinance should be revised to make currently operating tow yards compliant. they're hammering out whether extending that limit out 2 or 3 miles would work for everyone.</div>

<div>again, the current ordinance requires that towing companies store towed cars *within city limits.* currently, if your car has been towed in charlottesville, it's almost certainly been an illegal tow. https://t.co/475cCLFkdY</div>

<div>towing advisory board meeting adjourned. i'm so hopeful that it'll just take one more meeting until this revised towing ordinance is ready to be reviewed by the city attorney's office & maybe passed off to council for a vote??? they've been working on it for like 2 years?</div>

<div>wayne asked buzz if he plans to re-apply to the board... he says "we'll see," which is better than no! buzz says "this was our most productive meeting in a long time, which was encouraging." (i agree wholeheartedly & i think the board needs buzz!) https://t.co/mt2zRAT6ys</div>
