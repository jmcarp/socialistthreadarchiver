<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371908604362694661 target=_blank>"obviously the budget making is still happening," says chris engel of the office of economic development, when asked for a status update on the new garage. (while the budget is not final, council has settled on deferring the project for a year due to serious budget constraints.)</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371908603037245447 target=_blank>pretty short agenda for today's meeting of charlottesville's parking advisory panel, a small staff advisory body that has long functioned as a pro-parking advocacy group but recently added members who see parking a little bit differently https://t.co/zEjQ26lx3V</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371910062118162436 target=_blank>at the request of one of the panel members who is also a member of the downtown business association, chris engel is giving a powerpoint that he previously presented to the DBAC. https://t.co/q89c5bhnNJ</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371910067298185221 target=_blank>screensharing is going really well (this is supposed to show the powerpoint) https://t.co/Tfq44aaHfX</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371910828933443584 target=_blank>most of the data in the powerpoint comes from the 2015 parking study the city paid a consultant a lot of money to generate, yet somehow staff consistently draw the opposite conclusions using that data (like using it to justify building a new garage) https://t.co/74fscsU0bG https://t.co/s3ibo1W1Ax</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371913311252529159 target=_blank>@whatthecarp made this great tool for visualizing how many parking spots are used at any given time in both downtown garages, which i find more useful than most of the data presented by the city https://t.co/ucaHpqWmvx https://t.co/SYxMQWOkpS</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371913313358077957 target=_blank>most of the demand for parking in the garages downtown is between 7am and 6pm on weekdays! it's office workers! we have no idea how that demand will change when people return to their offices for work. it's likely we won't see 100% of office workers return to 100% in person work.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371914237895966720 target=_blank>michael rodi says as a business owner, lack of vehicle access to his business causes problems with receiving services like plumbers & electricians - he says many businesses just won't service downtown businesses at all because there are no convenient places to park their trucks.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371914236746686467 target=_blank>joan fenton says the lack of easy downtown parking makes it "difficult to hire," and if prospective employees can't find parking right by work, they'll find someplace else to work.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371914235605815300 target=_blank>additionally, the city could work with some of the bigger employers downtown on encouraging employees to use the commuter lot & take the bus downtown! i didn't even know such a thing EXISTED when i worked downtown.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371914238944542720 target=_blank>(the issue of your electrician not being able to park his truck close directly in front of your restaurant to conveniently access all of his tools will not be solved by building a fifteen million dollar parking garage, though)</a>

<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371915358664335362 target=_blank>sorry, the screenshot here cut off the date - the previous graph shows parking utilization for january 2020, pre-pandemic. here's january 2021 - there are always hundreds of empty spots these days. https://t.co/DvEypEuB6U https://t.co/Ts1mm8nx55</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371915364217589761 target=_blank>on to discussion of the agreement the city made with albemarle county - this agreement is being used to justify building the garage, but the agreement does NOT specify that the city has to build a new garage. the county can choose from the two options here https://t.co/Tkk7DT4u0s</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371916669279436800 target=_blank>rick siebert is deeply concerned that simply marking 100 spaces for county use would be useless, "people ignore signs." i can't imagine as parking director he is oblivious to options like "a parking permit" and "permit enforcement."</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371917251172044800 target=_blank>these meetings always make me feel really crazy. people just confidently asserting things that are directly contrary to reality, for which ample data exists to prove what's true, and everyone just agreeing and yes-and'ing this new reality.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371918976968712198 target=_blank>"given continued growth of the city, who's to say we won't be having this same conversation about parking management in 2031?" asks panel member @jbouie "there's no actual way to build ourselves out of a parking problem," assuming the city continues to grow.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371918979137212421 target=_blank>rick siebert, the city's parking director, says there's a strong desire to keep charlottesville a community that is based around single family homes. panel member @jakefmooney asks where that is coming from, "i didn't think that was settled."</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371918978109603846 target=_blank>the parking advisory panel has always focused on building more parking, preventing loss of parking spots by sabotaging bike lanes, advocating for every single parking spot... but that's parking ADVOCACY. they need to focus on reducing the NEED for parking.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371920067257044996 target=_blank>(they are a staff advisory body! they absolutely can provide advice to staff that addressing the city's parking issues is contingent on more attention paid to & funding for non-car transit options! these things are related! they're inextricably linked!)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371920066200141827 target=_blank>"for a community that loves biking, we have terrible bike lanes," says michael rodi. he says the public transit is terrible - his restaurant employees can't take the bus home late at night or on holidays! but then he says these are things the parking advisory panel can't address.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371920535609876486 target=_blank>the money is fungible, jake says. instead of spending millions on a garage, some of that money can be spent on transportation improvements.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371920534489944067 target=_blank>"the alternative is not 'do nothing,'" jake mooney says about the parking garage. pro-garage panelists see it as the ONLY solution to honoring our agreement with the county, but it isn't 'build the garage or do nothing and let the garage fill up.'</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371920907518803969 target=_blank>kirby hutto says "yes we have all these other needs," but the ability to hold festivals and concerts downtown is very important to the community & if we lose the ability for people to park immediately adjacent to those events, they lose the ability to have the events at all.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371921466959261702 target=_blank>rick siebert seems offended that jake implied the data that was shown was meant to persuade the viewer that the garage should be built. "i'm not skewing data to make it look one way or the other. the data's the data."</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371921465415716865 target=_blank>again, here's the usage data for the garage (january 2020) - it's full during the workday https://t.co/DvEypEuB6U</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371921877917179904 target=_blank>jamelle says we don't really have concrete evidence here directly linking available parking and economic activity. and it's true - they keep talking about the ECONOMIC need for more parking for evening & weekend visitors, but the data doesn't show a shortage at those times.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371922495020883968 target=_blank>siebert says he feels we are "reaching an inflection point," and one of the garages is hitting capacity many weekdays between 11am and 2pm. he recalls one time he can remember during a tedtalk event that BOTH garages were full. he concedes this is very rare.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371922669331959810 target=_blank>it's interesting to hear him so passionately say that he FEELS we need more parking while in the same breath conceding that the data shows this isn't really true. so much of the anxiety about parking is just perception & emotion! but we have the data!</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371923335265853442 target=_blank>"i think people are going to go out more after COVID," says michael cusano. he says it takes longer to take the bus than it does to walk, which is why he drives downtown.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371925552844713984 target=_blank>joan fenton suggests that we move on, as it's been over an hour on this subject. jake says he knows he has sent material to siebert & knows other members have also sent things to siebert, but there's no way to see what other members have sent in & suggests one document.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371926123962064901 target=_blank>siebert says he's heard talk about transportation management but thinks many people have a backwards perspective about it. "transportation management is about transportation," not parking, he says. he doesn't think it belongs in the parking action plan.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371926571527892995 target=_blank>jake isn't saying the parking panel should be trying to solve all the city's problems... but these things have to be in conversation with one another. the deal with the county may have been a "good deal" if you're only thinking about parking, but it's a terrible deal overall!</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371926570458288128 target=_blank>"it feels a little artificial to me to be talking about just parking," to "cordon off" parking from things like transportation & development, jake mooney says.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371928284800368642 target=_blank>siebert: "i hate to say this but this is kind of not our issue." it's up to the city traffic engineer, specifically saying that it's the traffic engineer's sole domain when it comes to issues of public safety (good to keep in mind when they try to kill bike lanes to save parking)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371928283672145924 target=_blank>cusano says the city threatened to 'take away' parking in cul de sacs if people don't stop parking perpendicular to the curb. danny yoder says cul de sacs are places for fire trucks to turn around, which would be impossible if people are parked perpendicular to the curbs.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371928281981804548 target=_blank>michael cusano asks if anyone wants to discuss 'the cul de sac letter.' apparently every resident who lives in a cul de sac received a letter from the city telling them not to park perpendicular to the curb, only parallel. apparently people are heated about it.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371928280840949775 target=_blank>michael rodi says the panel has to limit its scope because they only meet for an hour a month (they're allowed to meet longer, they just don't want to i guess), and makes a motion to adjourn which joan fenton seconds.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1371928286134173697 target=_blank>joan interjects to re-up the motion to adjourn and the meeting does end abruptly without any vote taken on the motion to adjourn</a>
