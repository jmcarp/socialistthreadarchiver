<div>this was just about a year ago — the board voted last january (while i watched from the freezing outdoor overflow area) to do nothing about the current policy. come on out to the jail (it’s literally at the jail) at 12:30 to see if they can do better. https://t.co/6lLVvulggY</div>

<div>she says if they’re in jail, it’s because they committed a crime. (this isn’t necessarily true.) “these illegals need to be returned to their countries.” she’s talking about “angel moms and angel dads” - parents of people killed by “illegals.”</div>

<div>the next speaker approaches the podium with his young daughter. he is opposed to the policy. in may 2013, a relative of his, a permanent resident, was charged with a misdemeanor. she served 40 days here at ACRJ. “she made a mistake and she paid for that mistake.”</div>

<div>next speaker urges them to stop or limit ICE notifications. “whether they pick someone up doesn’t seem to have anything to do” with the severity of the (alleged) crime. it’s random. it’s minor misdemeanors. people who haven’t even been convicted.</div>

<div>so this proposed change would eliminate the $1/day charge to inmates. but work release & trustee inmates (ones who work here in the facility) already don’t pay the $1/day... they’re exempt from THAT, but are charged $8/day under another policy.</div>

<div>steve carter, the representative from nelson county, seems to be the only person at the table vocally in favor of continuing to charge inmates $1/day to be in jail.</div>

<div>van clief is still not happy with the $8/fee for inmates on work release. it makes sense when you consider kumer’s motivation - the inmate pays this out of their wages, the burden isn’t on what they keep calling “the community.” (incarcerated workers ARE part of our community!)</div>

<div>kumer’s motivation is, in his mind, humanitarian. he doesn’t think “people who’ve done nothing wrong” should have to bear the cost. he says inmates don’t pay, their families do.</div>

<div>steve carter says he needs more time to think about it & that he would abstain if they took a vote now. even if they voted today, the policy wouldn’t take effect until july.</div>

<div>van clief says maybe if they dropped the absurdly high prices of commissary items, inmates would be able to afford both ramen & the daily fee. mckeel seems to think she’s being ridiculous & adjourns the meeting.</div>
