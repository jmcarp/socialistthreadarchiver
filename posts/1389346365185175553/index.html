<div>there is some public comment on the consent agenda. former city councilor kristin szakos says the recent state supreme court decision allows council to remove the statues immediately, but she respects their decision to follow the process outlined by the state law.</div>

<div>"our moral toxic waste cannot be exported to do its damage elsewhere," szakos says. we can't just MOVE these statues to be displayed elsewhere. the SCOVA decision reversed the attorneys fees awarded to the monument fund - the city should use that money to remove the statues ASAP.</div>

<div>szakos says "speed is of the essence," and urges council to vote to remove the statues immediately following the public hearing they are about to set for next month. "i urge you to remove them, whether or not their final disposition has been determined."</div>

<div>next is UVA professor larycia hawkins, also about the statues. she traces her own lineage to people held in slavery here in virginia. "this place is pocked with memories and histories," she says. these statues are, to her, "akin to superfund sites."</div>

<div>"they are more than just symbols - we've seen that they serve as motivations for hate," gathers says of the confederate statues that continue to serve as lightning rods for hate. even 3.5 years after they sparked a nazi rally, they still draw hate group members to them.</div>

<div>lena seville has also called in to stress that just moving the statues out of *our* town square isn't enough - we need to ensure they aren't just moved to some other public square where they'll do the same harm. she suggests melting them down & transforming them.</div>

<div>on the subject of the statues - people have been asking council WHY they are choosing to follow the slower removal process laid out by the state law when the supreme court decision appears to mean we do not have to</div>

<div>look, we're not bragging or anything, but the city of charlottesville is one of only 12 localities in the commonwealth with a triple A bond rating, so that's neat right?</div>

<div>shockingly, NO ONE wanted to make a public comment about the bond issuance. councilor snook has a question about interest rates. krisy hammill says they expect a rate of about 1.75%. the bond issuance carries 5-0.</div>

<div>now an SUP for 64 university way. during the planning commission hearing, the property owners with concerns about the project all expressed concerns that amounted to "i don't like living near students." (note that it's surrounded by frat houses & a massive dorm complex) https://t.co/Rs9hM7607L</div>

<div>that seems like a really silly oversight & a simple fix! students who live .5 miles from the university & use the university bus to get around do not all need a parking space or a car at all & the code shouldn't require us to pretend they do.</div>

<div>this definitely can't get changed tonight, but one thing that came up in the PC hearing about this SUP is that the city code allows for a reduction in parking requirements if a development is near a CITY bus stop... but no such allowance exists for university transit.</div>

<div>ok that issue didn't even come up, perhaps another time. the SUP for 64 university way carried 5-0. on to the critical slope waiver for 915 6th st SE. staff & the planning commission recommended approval.</div>

<div>the appointment of acting city attorney lisa robertson as city attorney carries 5-0. i guess winning a state supreme court appeal is a pretty good audition for the role. glad to see her get the title for the job she's been doing.</div>

<div>mayor walker (running for re-election) and heather hill (not running, term up this year) are the current reps to that working group. mayor walker said she would continue as the rep to that working group. no one acknowledged heather's hint that it's an election year.</div>

<div>ms rosia, who identifies herself as a victim of the summer of hate, asks council to consider the needs of those victims, urging them to bring the statues down as quickly as possible. (the longer this process drags on, the more likely we are to see more violence because of them)</div>
