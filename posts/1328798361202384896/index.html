<div>joan fenton says the $90,000 allocated to 'downtown mall ambassadors' was not well spent, that the people hired were "not well-suited" for it, just retirees who didn't do anything. she also says the CSOs from the police department are rude to people.</div>

<div>i agree that police officers shouldn't ever speak to anyone, but joan seems to think the answer to the problem is to give downtown business owners more input on how police officers are trained, so the police will be nicer to their customers????</div>

<div>kirby hutto says there are some cars parked downtown that appear to have been there for weeks, that they are covered in leaves, and have not received any parking tickets. (but is an anecdote from the pandemic world relevant? there's no shortage of parking downtown right now)</div>

<div>jake mooney rightly points out there is a real disconnect in the rhetoric here - members of the panel are talking about the need for rigorous enforcement to increase parking turnover... but also talking about how it shouldn't be so rigorous that it upsets people.</div>

<div>the idea is for this proposed contract parking enforcement to be "self funding" - the revenue from actively ticketing parking violations will more than pay for the cost of hiring this outside company to do the enforcement. i... don't think this works under pandemic circumstances.</div>

<div>there's also the issue of the police department being opposed to it. there is concern that people angry about getting a ticket/trying to appeal a ticket will (incorrectly) show up at the police department with their complaints. (how WOULD appeals be handled, though?)</div>

<div>"i'm not sure what our purpose is in having this discussion for the fifth or sixth time," kirby says (i agree! what is the point of this! there's never a vote or an action plan or a proposal to actually do anything or tell anyone about it, they just chat about it every month)</div>

<div>joan fenton says "politically, it's a good time to present again" to council on the issue of private parking enforcement, since there is conversation about what jobs the police do or don't do in the community. kirby hutto agrees they should bring it to council.</div>

<div>rick siebert, the city's parking manager, reminds the panel that an RFP is a months-long process. even if they put out an RFP tomorrow, it would be months before anything actually came to fruition.</div>

<div>"the good news is, it doesn't require any particular education," siebert says about the job of writing parking tickets, which he describes as boring, tiring, but well-paying (he says it would pay $15/hr but i'm not sure contract employees are subject to the city employee minimum)</div>

<div>there's been a motion to ask city council to consider contract parking enforcement (which would mean it could end up on a council agenda 2+ months from now, then maybe an RFP could be put out a few months after that?)</div>

<div>"i don't think that waiting until the dust settles is a good idea because the dust doesn't seem to want to settle," says mike rodi, saying the panel shouldn't wait for the "perpetual transition" in city leadership to pass. the motion carries.</div>

<div>jake mooney asks if the stated goal of the parking advisory panel of maintaining & growing the supply of parking is a given - is growth of parking supply necessarily always the ultimate goal?</div>

<div>i don't think the actual data supports siebert's claim that the market street garage is closed due to being full several times per week. the data exists, i just don't have it on hand at the moment.</div>
