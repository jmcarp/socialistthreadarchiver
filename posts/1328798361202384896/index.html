<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328798361202384896 target=_blank>it is time for another exciting meeting of the parking advisory panel https://t.co/KX6bYA4JNS</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328798688915894273 target=_blank>consistency is nice but it's weird they've had the same agenda items basically for two years and nothing ever changes at all https://t.co/NCHB9kEnHr</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328801888683372545 target=_blank>this conversation has been going in circles for as long as i've known about the existence of this body & it's never, to my knowledge, come up for discussion by council. https://t.co/YKlBgyYNvZ</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328802071714344960 target=_blank>i'm not kidding. they have the same conversation every month. https://t.co/bCbVhXPzGe</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328802333963247617 target=_blank>(except i'm just now noticing that chief brackney hates both possible outcomes? she hates having cops do parking enforcement and also won't endorse having a private company do it?)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328803456652627970 target=_blank>joan fenton says the $90,000 allocated to 'downtown mall ambassadors' was not well spent, that the people hired were "not well-suited" for it, just retirees who didn't do anything. she also says the CSOs from the police department are rude to people.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328803689071587335 target=_blank>i agree that police officers shouldn't ever speak to anyone, but joan seems to think the answer to the problem is to give downtown business owners more input on how police officers are trained, so the police will be nicer to their customers????</a>
</div>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328804004227375104 target=_blank>kirby hutto says there are some cars parked downtown that appear to have been there for weeks, that they are covered in leaves, and have not received any parking tickets. (but is an anecdote from the pandemic world relevant? there's no shortage of parking downtown right now)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328804764071698433 target=_blank>jake mooney rightly points out there is a real disconnect in the rhetoric here - members of the panel are talking about the need for rigorous enforcement to increase parking turnover... but also talking about how it shouldn't be so rigorous that it upsets people.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328805071107330051 target=_blank>joan fenton says people parking all day is "detrimental to business." (the people parking all day work at those businesses)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328806686665150465 target=_blank>the idea is for this proposed contract parking enforcement to be "self funding" - the revenue from actively ticketing parking violations will more than pay for the cost of hiring this outside company to do the enforcement. i... don't think this works under pandemic circumstances.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328806896703299585 target=_blank>there's also the issue of the police department being opposed to it. there is concern that people angry about getting a ticket/trying to appeal a ticket will (incorrectly) show up at the police department with their complaints. (how WOULD appeals be handled, though?)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328807576943865859 target=_blank>the phrase "west main street streetscape plan" sends me into a fugue state</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328808328684859393 target=_blank>"i'm not sure what our purpose is in having this discussion for the fifth or sixth time," kirby says (i agree! what is the point of this! there's never a vote or an action plan or a proposal to actually do anything or tell anyone about it, they just chat about it every month)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328808585573388289 target=_blank>joan fenton says "politically, it's a good time to present again" to council on the issue of private parking enforcement, since there is conversation about what jobs the police do or don't do in the community. kirby hutto agrees they should bring it to council.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328808913073008644 target=_blank>rick siebert, the city's parking manager, reminds the panel that an RFP is a months-long process. even if they put out an RFP tomorrow, it would be months before anything actually came to fruition.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328809286294757385 target=_blank>"the good news is, it doesn't require any particular education," siebert says about the job of writing parking tickets, which he describes as boring, tiring, but well-paying (he says it would pay $15/hr but i'm not sure contract employees are subject to the city employee minimum)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328809683218477061 target=_blank>there's been a motion to ask city council to consider contract parking enforcement (which would mean it could end up on a council agenda 2+ months from now, then maybe an RFP could be put out a few months after that?)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328810052820590593 target=_blank>"i don't think that waiting until the dust settles is a good idea because the dust doesn't seem to want to settle," says mike rodi, saying the panel shouldn't wait for the "perpetual transition" in city leadership to pass. the motion carries.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328812038127280130 target=_blank>hereâ€™s me paying attention during discussion of the parking action plan https://t.co/wAudkXB11b</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328813006487171073 target=_blank>jake mooney asks if the stated goal of the parking advisory panel of maintaining & growing the supply of parking is a given - is growth of parking supply necessarily always the ultimate goal?</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328813663512371202 target=_blank>i don't think the actual data supports siebert's claim that the market street garage is closed due to being full several times per week. the data exists, i just don't have it on hand at the moment.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1328815972610924544 target=_blank>lmao they just moved onto the agenda item for public comment & brian said "there are two people on the webinar and neither of them is raising their hand." (i assume the other person is @RoryStolzenberg) meeting adjourned.</a>
