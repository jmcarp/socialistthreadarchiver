<div>"why is the sacagawea statue lumped in there?" you might be asking. in 2019, council met with descendants of sacagawea who told them the statue of their ancestor cowering was so offensive to them they were ashamed to show it to their children. https://t.co/shu5BzyGjv</div>

<div>city manager chip boyles says the city is receiving about $19mil in ARP funding - half this year, half next year. final regulations on how it can be spent aren't out yet & his office is waiting to make final recommendations until more info is in about revenue losses. https://t.co/iiuSNKxP08</div>

<div>but in the meantime, the city manager's office is recommending going ahead and funding several social & business support programs, including the peace in the streets gun violence prevention program. this can come to a vote for appropriation at the meeting on the 19th.</div>

<div>boyles' office also recommends funding for eviction prevention, largely in the form of community outreach in making sure people are able to access existing eviction prevention programs, their legal rights, etc. but does include legal help for cases that do end up in court.</div>

<div>on to the bus driver issue: boyles says we aren't alone in having trouble finding bus drivers, calling it a "national epidemic." his office proposes offering $2400 bonuses (to be paid over a 9 month period) and better benefits to help attract school bus drivers.</div>

<div>boyles says they also recommend offering the same bonus & benefit improvements for CAT bus drivers so we don't create a problem for ourselves where CAT bus drivers just switch jobs to get the bonus, leaving us without CAT bus drivers.</div>

<div>and now on to public comment. first up is malcolm bell, an art historian and former chair of UVA's art department. he is upset that the sacagawea statue is being included in the conversation about the confederate statues. "it is completely innocent of the accusations" against it.</div>
