<div>perhaps worthwhile to note that the southwood community is predominantly latinx. albemarle county is 80% white as of the last census, probably a little less now. every single member of the board of supervisors is white.</div>

<div>this isn’t about building a community where none currently exists. this is about allowing an existing community to improve itself. this is about allowing a close knit community to engage in resident driven redevelopment.</div>

<div>given that albemarle county census shows about 5,500 people self identify as hispanic & southwood is 1500 people, the overwhelming majority of whom are latinx, it’s fair to say this is probably the county’s largest latinx community.</div>

<div>liz palmer is concerned that the 30ft buffer along old lynchburg rd is 30ft INCLUDING the trail, not 30ft + the trail. she’s brought this up twice already tonight. i hope that’s not concerning enough for her to go against both staff & the planning commission’s recommendation.</div>
