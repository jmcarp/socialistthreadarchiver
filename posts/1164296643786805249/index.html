<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164296643786805249 target=_blank>back at the albemarle county office building tonight for the county board of supervisors vote on the southwood rezoning. another packed house!</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164302973763301376 target=_blank>extremely long set of instructions for public comment from the board of supervisors, including a reminder that clapping is NOT allowed. you‚Äôre supposed to ‚Äúraise your hand‚Äù to show ‚Äúsupport or opposition‚Äù to a speaker. ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164305851072602113 target=_blank>the board of supervisors hasn‚Äôt looked at this since a joint session with the planning commission last year. the clerk says she knows there will be a lot of questions and comments & provides a brief overview of the project. https://t.co/QF5gHyG2v7</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164308662850138112 target=_blank>apparently a ‚Äúcenter‚Äù is actually a defined term - the clerk clarified that it means ‚Äúfocal point,‚Äù rather than referring to a geographic location. https://t.co/NYU4NvUJjP</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164309168230215680 target=_blank>(county board of supervisors is NOT my usual meeting beat and she has no nameplate. i assume the woman at the end of the dais reading to the board is the clerk. my apologies if that‚Äôs not her title.)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164309505439686656 target=_blank>staff have recommended approval of the rezoning. supervisor liz palmer asks the presenter, who just finished, to go back to the slide about ‚Äúunfavorable‚Äù aspects of the rezoning.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164310100426797056 target=_blank>the woman presenting to the BOS is actually the senior planner - my apologies. at city meetings, staff presenting to council never sit at the dais. the seat on the far end of the dais is always the clerk at city council meetings.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164310808395952128 target=_blank>there are only two points on the ‚Äúunfavorable factors‚Äù slide - added traffic on old lynchburg road and added students to cale elementary. as to the second factor: https://t.co/J8JeGOfsjP</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164311394394804225 target=_blank>supervisor ann mallek has questions about stormwater. the applicant has a total of 20 minutes to address the board.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164312633161527298 target=_blank>perhaps worthwhile to note that the southwood community is predominantly latinx. albemarle county is 80% white as of the last census, probably a little less now. every single member of the board of supervisors is white.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164315189807706112 target=_blank>this isn‚Äôt about building a community where none currently exists. this is about allowing an existing community to improve itself. this is about allowing a close knit community to engage in resident driven redevelopment.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164315187924676608 target=_blank>given that albemarle county census shows about 5,500 people self identify as hispanic & southwood is 1500 people, the overwhelming majority of whom are latinx, it‚Äôs fair to say this is probably the county‚Äôs largest latinx community.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164316426880131077 target=_blank>the applicant is presenting a lot of data. the vast majority of families in the community fall below 80% AMI, with 80 families below 25% AMI. nearly 3/4 of families fall within the AMI range that qualifies them for habitat for humanity support.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164316923166900226 target=_blank>liz palmer is concerned that the 30ft buffer along old lynchburg rd is 30ft INCLUDING the trail, not 30ft + the trail. she‚Äôs brought this up twice already tonight. i hope that‚Äôs not concerning enough for her to go against both staff & the planning commission‚Äôs recommendation.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164317948242214912 target=_blank>supervisor normal dill asks how the resident designers choose where their houses will be and what they will look like & who leads that process.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164317950507192330 target=_blank>‚Äúwe start with the dreaming side - what are you looking for? what do you want?‚Äù and the habitat team works with them to design something that fits their needs that they can afford.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164318870976565249 target=_blank>supervisor rick randolph says an earlier submission said residents prioritized leaving green space for their children, but comes in with what he seems to think is a gotcha about how the final proposal has less green space.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164319201798103046 target=_blank>the applicant says the resident design team ultimately sacrificed some green space for more single family units, while still leaving sufficient green space for kids.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164319732125839365 target=_blank>‚Äúdoes the applicant really believe that 4900 sq ft is adequate,‚Äù randolph asks about the recreational space. the applicant says there‚Äôs more focus on active recreational space vs the passive recreational space represented by that green space.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164320243549921281 target=_blank>again, let me remind you we aren‚Äôt talking about building a new community. we are talking about allowing a community that is currently old trailers with failing infrastructure to redevelop in a way envisioned by its residents. rick can take his concerns about soccer & shut up.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164320769788321797 target=_blank>rick randolph is clearly very hurt that there was a meeting to which BOS members were not invited.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164321441636114432 target=_blank>randolph is skeptical that habitat for humanity knows how to ensure units are affordable for poor people. which is... kind of their whole deal. i think they know how to do that.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164322689877729280 target=_blank>is he saying mixed income development is impossible because people who aren‚Äôt poor can‚Äôt be expected to live near poor people?</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164322687507992581 target=_blank>i am having trouble understanding exactly what randolph means by that last comment about the presence of low income families over time leading to the entire complex becoming low income housing.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164323158960291845 target=_blank>dill asks about the financial counseling offered by habitat. habitat has staff that meet with families about financial planning and budgeting.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164323690416394242 target=_blank>‚Äútwenty minutes‚Äù fifty minutes ago https://t.co/GtCze2xxw6</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164324058621730816 target=_blank>randolph has another GOTCHA question about where people will park their riding lawnmowers.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164324242361655296 target=_blank>‚Äúwhen they design their house, they can design a shed in the back,‚Äù the applicant says. the design plan also has a storage lot for work vehicles & trailers.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164324698731233282 target=_blank>rick please just allow this to move forward. vote no if you must but shut the fuck up.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164325377646440449 target=_blank>there are maybe 200 people here, many of whom want to give a public comment. rick has been dominating what was supposed to be a 20 minute presentation/Q&A with the application for an hour. he is being immensely disrespectful of this community.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164325380305641473 target=_blank>jesus christ he just used a wimbledon tennis court as a size reference for a building. read the fucking room rick.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164326413610225664 target=_blank>randolph says accusations that mosby mountain residents‚Äô concerns about the southwood community are racist & classist are ‚Äúinsulting.‚Äù (but they‚Äôre also true, rick)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164326410447663104 target=_blank>does rick randolph live in mosby mountain? because he‚Äôs representing their concerns pretty strongly.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164327185034948610 target=_blank>i assume he‚Äôs referring to comments like this one from the planning commission meeting about the project last month. so many of the arguments against this project are bad faith criticisms & barely papered over racism. https://t.co/EfTYEsX7Qo</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164327925036007425 target=_blank>randolph is now showing a series of photographs he took along the road onto which he‚Äôs drawn a red line indicating a height of 50ft. he insists there must be a tree buffer ‚Äúto shield these massive buildings‚Äù from the road.</a>
</div>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164328047627120641 target=_blank>god forbid you be able to see a building that contains poor people https://t.co/tKT8kFZpnA</a>

<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164354291890606080 target=_blank>he claims one of his big issues is that the planned development contains many units that would not be occupied by current southwood residents. that if it were ‚Äú100% southwood,‚Äù maybe it would be different.</a>
