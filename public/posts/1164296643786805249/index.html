<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164296643786805249 target=_blank>back at the albemarle county office building tonight for the county board of supervisors vote on the southwood rezoning. another packed house!</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164302973763301376 target=_blank>extremely long set of instructions for public comment from the board of supervisors, including a reminder that clapping is NOT allowed. you’re supposed to “raise your hand” to show “support or opposition” to a speaker. 🤔🤷‍♀️</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164305851072602113 target=_blank>the board of supervisors hasn’t looked at this since a joint session with the planning commission last year. the clerk says she knows there will be a lot of questions and comments & provides a brief overview of the project. https://t.co/QF5gHyG2v7</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164308662850138112 target=_blank>apparently a “center” is actually a defined term - the clerk clarified that it means “focal point,” rather than referring to a geographic location. https://t.co/NYU4NvUJjP</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164309168230215680 target=_blank>(county board of supervisors is NOT my usual meeting beat and she has no nameplate. i assume the woman at the end of the dais reading to the board is the clerk. my apologies if that’s not her title.)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164309505439686656 target=_blank>staff have recommended approval of the rezoning. supervisor liz palmer asks the presenter, who just finished, to go back to the slide about “unfavorable” aspects of the rezoning.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164310100426797056 target=_blank>the woman presenting to the BOS is actually the senior planner - my apologies. at city meetings, staff presenting to council never sit at the dais. the seat on the far end of the dais is always the clerk at city council meetings.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164310808395952128 target=_blank>there are only two points on the “unfavorable factors” slide - added traffic on old lynchburg road and added students to cale elementary. as to the second factor: https://t.co/J8JeGOfsjP</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164311394394804225 target=_blank>supervisor ann mallek has questions about stormwater. the applicant has a total of 20 minutes to address the board.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164312633161527298 target=_blank>perhaps worthwhile to note that the southwood community is predominantly latinx. albemarle county is 80% white as of the last census, probably a little less now. every single member of the board of supervisors is white.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164315189807706112 target=_blank>this isn’t about building a community where none currently exists. this is about allowing an existing community to improve itself. this is about allowing a close knit community to engage in resident driven redevelopment.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164315187924676608 target=_blank>given that albemarle county census shows about 5,500 people self identify as hispanic & southwood is 1500 people, the overwhelming majority of whom are latinx, it’s fair to say this is probably the county’s largest latinx community.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164316426880131077 target=_blank>the applicant is presenting a lot of data. the vast majority of families in the community fall below 80% AMI, with 80 families below 25% AMI. nearly 3/4 of families fall within the AMI range that qualifies them for habitat for humanity support.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164316923166900226 target=_blank>liz palmer is concerned that the 30ft buffer along old lynchburg rd is 30ft INCLUDING the trail, not 30ft + the trail. she’s brought this up twice already tonight. i hope that’s not concerning enough for her to go against both staff & the planning commission’s recommendation.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164317948242214912 target=_blank>supervisor normal dill asks how the resident designers choose where their houses will be and what they will look like & who leads that process.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164317950507192330 target=_blank>“we start with the dreaming side - what are you looking for? what do you want?” and the habitat team works with them to design something that fits their needs that they can afford.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164318870976565249 target=_blank>supervisor rick randolph says an earlier submission said residents prioritized leaving green space for their children, but comes in with what he seems to think is a gotcha about how the final proposal has less green space.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164319201798103046 target=_blank>the applicant says the resident design team ultimately sacrificed some green space for more single family units, while still leaving sufficient green space for kids.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164319732125839365 target=_blank>“does the applicant really believe that 4900 sq ft is adequate,” randolph asks about the recreational space. the applicant says there’s more focus on active recreational space vs the passive recreational space represented by that green space.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164320243549921281 target=_blank>again, let me remind you we aren’t talking about building a new community. we are talking about allowing a community that is currently old trailers with failing infrastructure to redevelop in a way envisioned by its residents. rick can take his concerns about soccer & shut up.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164320769788321797 target=_blank>rick randolph is clearly very hurt that there was a meeting to which BOS members were not invited.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164321441636114432 target=_blank>randolph is skeptical that habitat for humanity knows how to ensure units are affordable for poor people. which is... kind of their whole deal. i think they know how to do that.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164322689877729280 target=_blank>is he saying mixed income development is impossible because people who aren’t poor can’t be expected to live near poor people?</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164322687507992581 target=_blank>i am having trouble understanding exactly what randolph means by that last comment about the presence of low income families over time leading to the entire complex becoming low income housing.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164323158960291845 target=_blank>dill asks about the financial counseling offered by habitat. habitat has staff that meet with families about financial planning and budgeting.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164323690416394242 target=_blank>“twenty minutes” fifty minutes ago https://t.co/GtCze2xxw6</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164324058621730816 target=_blank>randolph has another GOTCHA question about where people will park their riding lawnmowers.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164324242361655296 target=_blank>“when they design their house, they can design a shed in the back,” the applicant says. the design plan also has a storage lot for work vehicles & trailers.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164324698731233282 target=_blank>rick please just allow this to move forward. vote no if you must but shut the fuck up.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164325377646440449 target=_blank>there are maybe 200 people here, many of whom want to give a public comment. rick has been dominating what was supposed to be a 20 minute presentation/Q&A with the application for an hour. he is being immensely disrespectful of this community.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164325380305641473 target=_blank>jesus christ he just used a wimbledon tennis court as a size reference for a building. read the fucking room rick.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164326413610225664 target=_blank>randolph says accusations that mosby mountain residents’ concerns about the southwood community are racist & classist are “insulting.” (but they’re also true, rick)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164326410447663104 target=_blank>does rick randolph live in mosby mountain? because he’s representing their concerns pretty strongly.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164327185034948610 target=_blank>i assume he’s referring to comments like this one from the planning commission meeting about the project last month. so many of the arguments against this project are bad faith criticisms & barely papered over racism. https://t.co/EfTYEsX7Qo</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164327925036007425 target=_blank>randolph is now showing a series of photographs he took along the road onto which he’s drawn a red line indicating a height of 50ft. he insists there must be a tree buffer “to shield these massive buildings” from the road.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164328047627120641 target=_blank>god forbid you be able to see a building that contains poor people https://t.co/tKT8kFZpnA</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164328652605202432 target=_blank>liz palmer: “i’m disappointed that there’s not more in the code of development” planning for “those kinds of quality of life concerns.” now on to the public hearing.</a>

<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164331171070775296 target=_blank>“please forgive any attendees’ lack of experience” in engaging with this process, he says. they’re just so excited about the project. (i wasn’t aware that anyone had negative things to say about the crowd at the last meeting! that’s really upsetting.)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164331641713647617 target=_blank>next speaker commends the board for the comprehensive plan & their commitment to revitalizing neighborhoods. “the habitat partnership is innovative, it’s out of the box” and partners with residents.</a>

</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164340103692640261 target=_blank>“southwood has a wonderful community spirit and this redevelopment allows that spirit to shine,” she says.</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164352107484536832 target=_blank>supervisor normal dill says he is frustrated. “we approve holiday inns, we approve car dealerships expanding, we approve wawas coming in,” he says those businesses know the system. “we have such a unique opportunity here.”</a>

<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164352112375078913 target=_blank>dill calls the stormwater concerns at this stage “a detail.” habitat has a strong track record as a reliable partner. “i’d much rather approve this and have some water issues then approve a business that’s selling petroleum products and junk food.”</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164352110823186433 target=_blank>dill: “this is such an amazingly unique, wonderful process.” habitat has been working with southwood for almost 30 years, he says. “it’s financially strong, it helps so many people, it has an incredible cadre of volunteers,” “we should be ready to go.”</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164352114967138304 target=_blank>ann mallek says all applicants should be held accountable for what’s presented at public meetings. “it’s difficult to look at plans,” (her comment is meandering and i’m not sure exactly what point she’s trying to make about the buildings in wickham pond being tall)</a>

<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164352623270649856 target=_blank>“i really hope that if people have particular questions that they raise them now,” mallek says (well yes now is the time because you have to vote tonight)</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164352625808150528 target=_blank>rick randolph, whose district this is in, starts out by quoting reagan, “trust but verify.” he says he hopes to reverse that be seeking to verify information that is not spelled out in the code of development (in what way is that the inverse of the quote?)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164353005979918337 target=_blank>randolph says he has ongoing questions about trees. he also wants more specifics on stormwater.</a>

<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164353003371057152 target=_blank>“for those of you in the audience who want to keep score by rumbling about” questions asked, randolph says “it’s not a game of winners and losers.” what the fuck is going on in this man’s brain?</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164353358796402688 target=_blank>he also wants more information about the impact on cale elementary and public transit. he says he doesn’t see “any effort” in the plan re: bus stops.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164353669514637313 target=_blank>randolph says the plan is “a delicious taste” but he needs to see more. he says they won’t be held to plans presented at this stage, but they need to see a road map.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164354097375522817 target=_blank>“if i had to vote right now,” because of the “significant issues” he has, “i would have to vote no,” randolph says. “there are still too many unanswered questions.”</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164354291890606080 target=_blank>he claims one of his big issues is that the planned development contains many units that would not be occupied by current southwood residents. that if it were “100% southwood,” maybe it would be different.</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164354555754287105 target=_blank>diantha mckeel asks if maybe 10 days, two weeks, to get more answers might help his concerns. randolph says that is something that could be worked out and he would be more comfortable with.</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164355441536786433 target=_blank>ann mallek says the buffer being referred to is the VDOT buffer and that’s not something the applicant can control. “are we expecting more than what our standard process is on the tree preservation process?” “do we have the authority to require this?”</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164355827882442752 target=_blank>about the trees & the expectation that they should render the development invisible, county attorney greg kamptner says this is a development area. everyone living in the area should expect that the land across the street is going to be developed.</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164359000311443456 target=_blank>i did not expect this to last more than four hours but here we are</a>

<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164359901482749953 target=_blank>the expansion of cale elementary is not yet in the CIP but is already being considered in long range planning.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164359905253478401 target=_blank>but if that school being a dozen students over capacity is a blocker for this project, i hope that means they aren’t allowing any other single development project that would add a single student to any county school.</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164360661276725248 target=_blank>now a transit planner is up addressing concerns about public transit. he says once the road system is built it won’t be a problem to add service to the area (but increased service would require increased funding)</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164360945575108608 target=_blank>randolph cannot fucking let this go. “the taxpayers in the future will pay to put in bus stops,” yeah, like they do in every community.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164361187179601920 target=_blank>this is a REZONING APPLICATION. how much detail is usually included in that? the roads don’t even EXIST YET how can they coordinate with CAT to determine the bus routes?</a>
</div>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164361689162244096 target=_blank>starting to feel bad for ann mallek. randolph has been interrupting her all night & galloway just did it pretty egregiously, too.</a>

<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164363639463337985 target=_blank>gallaway says he visited southwood with planning commissioner dotson. he says the project does have risks but they are acceptable risks.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164364083363307520 target=_blank>surprisingly, randolph makes the motion to approve the rezoning. and it passes unanimously to a loud round of applause and cheers from the gallery. after 4.5 hours, there are still 100+ people here.</a>
</div>
<div class=tweet>
<a href=https://twitter.com/socialistdogmom/status/1164364583752142854 target=_blank>there’s still a little meeting business to wrap up, but the crowd is slowly filtering out of chambers. people are cheering and embracing and laughing as they make their way out of the auditorium.</a>
